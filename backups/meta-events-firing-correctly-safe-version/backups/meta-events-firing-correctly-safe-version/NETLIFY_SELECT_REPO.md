# Netlify - Select Correct Repository

It looks like Netlify is showing the wrong repository (`pacopuylaertfuxia.github.io` instead of `priesmont-website`).

## How to Select the Correct Repository:

1. **Go back to repository selection:**
   - Look for a "Back" button or click on step "2. Select repository" in the progress bar
   - Or start over: Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project" → "GitHub"

2. **Search for your repository:**
   - In the repository list, look for `priesmont-website`
   - Or use the search box to type: `priesmont-website`
   - Click on `pacopuylaertfuxia/priesmont-website`

3. **If you don't see it:**
   - Make sure you authorized Netlify to access all repositories (not just selected ones)
   - Check that the repository is visible in your GitHub account
   - Try refreshing the page

## Alternative: Direct Link

You can also try going directly to:
```
https://app.netlify.com/start/repos/pacopuylaertfuxia/priesmont-website
```

## Configuration Settings (Once You Select the Right Repo):

- **Build command:** Leave empty
- **Publish directory:** `.` (dot/period)
- **Project name:** `priesmont` (or leave default)

Then click "Deploy site"!
